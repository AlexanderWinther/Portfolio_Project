        <div class="box">
            <span> My name is Alexander Winther, and I am a 22-year-old, who currently studies IT at Copenhagen School Of Design and Technology.
            I have previously worked in the restaurant business for the last 4 1/2 years at multiple restaurants, where I held job titles such as Waiter and Bartender.
            My responsibilities included serving customers, customer service and managing restaurant front as well as communication with kitchen staff.
                I also briefly studied at Copenhagen Hospitality College, where I was training to be a chef.
                I am a big fan of football and I support <a href="https://www.manutd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Manchester United">Manchester United</a>.
